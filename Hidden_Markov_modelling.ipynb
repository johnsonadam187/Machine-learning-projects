        "Markov models are predictive chain models that allow us to predict one thing based on 1) our knowledge of the probability of that specific thing (Transition Probability) and a somewhat related phenomenon (Emission probability). The common examples to explain this usually involve predicting the weather from the current weather state and a related phenomenon (Bill mostly takes a walk on sunny days).\r\n"

        "When we think about the possible states the weather can take on, the most simple way to describe it would to be 2 separate states (Sunny and Rainy). But to describe the cycle between these states requires more. It requires a description of the emission probability of values that might be observed (observation_Pr) during each state, and a description of the probability of transitioning between both states (transition_Pr), and a description of the state that it happens to currently be in (initial_Pr). So understanding the descriptions themselves informs us of how to construct them. The initial_Pr can only have two possible values, the data is categorical, therefore we construct a Categorical distribution object. Similarly, the transition_Pr can only have 4 possible states, so the data is also categorical. The emission property (in this instance) has been deemed to be continuous and so we will create a normal distribution object for that."
